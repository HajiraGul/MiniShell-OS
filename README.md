# MiniShell-OS
A cross-platform command-line shell implementation in Python. This shell provides a comprehensive set of features, including built-in commands, I/O redirection, piping, command history, and tab completion, mimicking the behavior of traditional UNIX/Linux shells.

---
## Project Overview

This "IIUI Mini Shell" project is a Python-based command-line interface designed to provide a hands-on understanding of fundamental Operating Systems concepts. It interprets user commands, executes them either internally or via the system shell, and integrates advanced features like process management, I/O stream handling, and command history, making it a robust learning tool for shell design and implementation.

---

### ðŸš€ Core Functionality
-   **Built-in Commands**: `cd`, `pwd`, `clear`, `history`, `help`, `touch`, `rm`, `cat`, `exit`. These commands are handled directly by the shell for efficiency and platform consistency.
-   **System Command Support**: Execute any external system command (e.g., `ls`, `echo`, `mkdir`, `whoami`, `date`, `grep`, `findstr`, etc.) by leveraging subprocesses.
-   **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly on Windows, Linux, and macOS environments.
-   **Command History**: Persistent command history is maintained across sessions, stored in a dedicated file.
-   **Tab Completion**: Auto-completion feature for built-in commands, enhancing user experience and command entry speed.

---

### ðŸ”§ Advanced Features
-   **I/O Redirection**: Comprehensive support for redirecting input (`<`) and output (`>`) streams for commands.
-   **Piping**: Allows chaining multiple commands together using the `|` operator, where the output of one command becomes the input of the next.
-   **Error Handling**: Robust and user-friendly error handling mechanisms to provide clear feedback for various command execution issues.
-   **Smart Prompt**: A dynamic and informative command prompt that intelligently displays the current working directory, abbreviating the home directory with `~`.

---
### ðŸŽ¯ Key Capabilities
-   **Platform Adaptation**: Automatically maps common UNIX commands like `ls` to `dir` and `grep` to `findstr` on Windows for a consistent user experience.
-   **Persistent History**: Command history is saved to `~/.iiui_shell_history` (or an appropriate path on Windows) and automatically loaded at startup.
-   **Graceful Exit**: Ensures proper cleanup and safe termination of the shell session upon `exit` command or EOF.
-   **Signal Handling**: Gracefully handles interrupt signals (e.g., Ctrl+C) and End-Of-File (EOF) conditions.

#### Method 1: Direct Python Execution
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the shell:
   ```bash
   python mini_shell.py
   ```

#### Method 2: Using Executable (Windows)
1. Download `mini_shell.exe` from the releases page
2. Double-click to run or execute from command prompt:
   ```cmd
   mini_shell.exe
   ```

#### Method 3: Using Executable (Linux/macOS)
1. Download the executable from the releases page
2. Make it executable and run:
